// This is the abstract Statement class, from which your various statement
// classes will need to extend.  There is only one method in the Statement
// class, an execute() method that executes the statement, making any
// necessary changes to the given ProgramState.

	// any necessary changes to the ProgramState (e.g. a new value for the
	// program counter, changing the value of some variable, pushing or
	// popping from the line number stack).
	
	// execute() also takes an ostream parameter;  if any output is to be
	// written, write it to the given ostream.

	// In the event that the execution of the statement causes a fatal error

	// a RETURN statement without a corresponding GOSUB, the program may exit
	// instead of returning from execute().
